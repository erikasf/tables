<!-- Table Header <th> gives your columns index head<th> works like <td> creating cell for data. diff is table header el3ement provides semantic value by signifying that the data within hte cell is a heading  while<td> thinks of it as just anothr cell.he headers attribute is very similar to the scope attribute. By default, the scope attribute may only be used on the <th> element. In the case that a cell, either a <td> or <th> element, needs to be associated with a different header, the headers attribute comes into play. The value of the headers attribute on a <td> or <th> element needs to match the id attribute value of the <th> element that cell pertains to.
<th> can be used with columns and rows
Scope  attribute helps to id what content a table header relates to . the scope att indiates values col, row ol group and twogroup. whether a a table header applies to a row or cfolujmn. the most ommon falues are col and row.

<!-- <caption>, <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>.
Table Caption

The <caption> element provides a caption or title for a table. A caption will help users identify what the table pertains to and what data they can expect to find within it. The <caption> element must come immediately after the opening <table> tag, and it is positioned at the top of a table by default. -->

<!-- The content within tables can be broken up into multiple groups, including a head, a body, and a foot. The <thead> (table head), <tbody> (table body), and <tfoot> (table foot) elements help to structurally organize tables.

The table head element, <thead>, wraps the heading row or rows of a table to denote the head. The table head should be placed at the top of a table, after any <caption> element and before any <tbody> element.

After the table head may come either the <tbody> or <tfoot> elements. Originally the <tfoot> element had to come immediately after the <thead> element, but HTML5 has provided leeway here. These elements may now occur in any order so long as they are never parent elements of one another. The <tbody> element should contain the primary data within a table, while the <tfoot> element contains data that outlines the contents of a table.

 <!-- border-collapse and border-spacing. -->
<!-- he border-collapse property determines a table’s border model. There are three values for the border-collapse property: collapse, separate, and inherit. By default, the border-collapse property value is separate, meaning that all of the different borders will stack up next to one another, as described above. The collapse property, on the other hand, condenses the borders into one, choosing the table cell as the primary border. -->
<!-- Border Spacing Property

As the border-collapse property with the separate value allows borders to be stacked up against one another, the border-spacing property can determine how much space, if any, appears between the borders.

For example, a table with a 1-pixel border around the entire table and a 1-pixel border around each cell will have a 2-pixel border all around every cell because the borders stack up next to one another. Adding in a border-spacing value of 4 pixels separates the borders by 4 pixels. -->

}

<!-- The border-spacing property works only when the border-collapse property value is separate, its default value. If the border-collapse property hasn’t been previously used, we can use the border-spacing property without worry.
 -->
<!-- Additionally, the border-spacing property may accept two length values: the first value for horizontal spacing and the second value for vertical spacing. The declaration border-spacing: 5px 10px;, for example, will place 5 pixels of horizontal spacing between borders and 10 pixels of vertical spacing between borders.
 -->
<!-- Adding Borders to Rows
 -->
<!-- Adding borders to a table can be tricky at times, particularly when putting borders between rows. Within a table, borders cannot be applied to <tr> elements or table structural elements, so when we want to put a border between rows some thought is required. -->

<!-- We’ll begin by making sure the table’s border-collapse property value is set to collapse, and then we’ll add a bottom border to each table cell, regardless of whether it’s a <th> or <td> element. If we wish, we can remove the bottom border from the cells within the last row of the table by using the :last-child pseudo-class selector to select the last <tr> element within the table and target the <td> elements within that row. Additionally, if a table is using the structural elements, we’ll want to make sure to prequalify the last row of the table as being within the <tfoot> element. -->

<!-- 
Table Striping
In the effort to make tables more legible, one common design practice is to “stripe” table rows with alternating background colors. This makes the rows clearer and provides a visual cue for scanning information. One way to do this is to place a class on every other <tr> element and set a background color to that class. Another, easier way is to use the :nth-child pseudo-class selector with an even or odd argument to select every other <tr> element.

Here, our table of books uses the :nth-child pseudo-class selector with an even argument to select all even table rows within the table and apply a gray background. Consequently, every other row within the table body is gray.

}

  border-left: 1px solid #cecfd5;
}
<!-- Within this code there are a few intricacies worth mentioning. To begin, the <table> element has an explicit border-collapse property set to separate and a border-spacing property set to 0. The reason for this is that the <td> elements include borders, while the <th> elements do not. Without the border-collapse property set to separate the borders of the <td> elements would make the body and foot of the table wider than the head. -->

<!-- Since the border-collapse property is set to separate we need to be careful as to how borders are applied to <td> elements. Here borders are set to the right and bottom of all <td> elements. Then, the very first <td> element within a <tr> element will receive a left border. As all of the <td> elements stack together so do their borders, providing the appearance of a solid border around each element. -->

<!-- Lastly, all <th> elements receive a blue background, and every even <tr> element receives a gray background by way of the :nth-child pseudo-class selector. -->
